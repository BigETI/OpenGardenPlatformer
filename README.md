# Open Garden Platformer

A cross-platform and open-source implementation of Daisy's Garden 2, using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and a custom 2D engine built around it.

The idea is to bring a 16-bit Windows application to the world of modern native applications.

This project is in a very early development stage.

Documentation will be published in the future.
